## Data Cleaning
After downloading the data,  I cleaned it for analysis. I made the following changes:

* Parsed datetime from *started_at and ended_at* columns:
  * *date_started, date_ended, time_started, time_ended, hour_started, hour_ended*  
* Columns created: 
    * Time spent riding bikes
    * Specified the day of the week for the ride
    * Determined if the ride was on a weekend
* Dropped duplicates and *NA* values from data

## EDA
I analysed the distributions of the data and the value counts of all the categorical variables to find if there were any trends. Below are some charts that I created from *Tableau* to display my findings:
